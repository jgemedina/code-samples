# General

The intention of this example app is to explore the different features of [CacheCow](CacheCow) for server-side, both basic and advanced.

# Stack

This software project uses to some level the following techniques:

* [ASP.NET Core 2.1](ASPNET)
* Docker / Docker Compose (Linux-based images)
* [CacheCow](CacheCow)

_Docker_ could definitely be omitted, however, we may _expand_ this solution in the near future, so, it may come handy.

# Iterations

TBD
