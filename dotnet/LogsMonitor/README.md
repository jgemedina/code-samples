# General

The intention of this example app is to explore the different features of [CacheCow](CacheCow) for server-side, both basic and advanced.

# Stack

This software project uses to some level the following techniques:

* [ASP.NET Core 2.1](ASPNET)
* Docker / Docker Compose (Linux-based images)
* [CacheCow](CacheCow

Not a full app as I wanted to go over some of the basic library elements.
